A tool to help associations to manage travel or material costs for events or ongoing jobs.

== Description ==
Lots of associations know the problem: Whenever they organize an event, the members have to pay for stuff and want to get their money back.
This tool helps by adding invoices or registering travel costs and also helps to create bank csv data.
As a treasurer you can also download the invoices as a pdf file.

Note: This tool is created for German legal, so keep in mind that you have to modify settings, when you use it in another country.
